# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 – Rust 🦀

**Advent of Code** is an annual programming challenge held every December, featuring daily puzzles that test problem-solving skills, algorithms, and optimization techniques.

This repository contains my **personal solutions for Advent of Code 2025**, all written in **Rust** 🦀.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some puzzle solutions may be **slow or unoptimized**.  
This is intentional in some cases, as the focus is on **learning, experimentation, and problem-solving**, rather than perfect performance.

I may revisit and optimize solutions later once better approaches are discovered.

## ⭐ Notes

- Solutions are written for learning and practice.
- Code quality and performance may vary per day.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy Coding & Merry AoC 🎅✨
